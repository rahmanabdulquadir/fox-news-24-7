          What is the difference between Var, Let, Const?

        <p class="text-l">
          In the var tab, when you will run the code, you will see an error as a
          is not defined because var variables are only accessible in the
          function scope. In the let tab, when you run the code, you will see an
          error as i is not defined because let variables are only accessible
          within the block they are declared. In the const tab, when you run the
          code, you will see that x was defined under the block was accessible,
          but when you try to access x outside that block, you will get an
          error.

        <p class="text-l">
          In regular function, arguments will give you list of parameter passed
          in function, In arrow function arguments is not defined. In regular
          function, you always have to return any value, but in Arrow function
          you can skip return keyword and write in single line. In arrow
          function parameters should be unique.

          What is difference between Map, ForEach, Filter and Find?

        <p class="text-l">
          .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns
          a new array with the updated elements. .forEach(), is used to execute
          the same code on every element in an array but does not change the
          array and it returns undefined. .filter() checks every element in an
          array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array
          with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. .find() is also
          a search function like the previous but they differ in one small
          detail â€” this function returns only one match in an array

        <h1 class="text-3xl">The usage of Template String</h1>
        <p class="text-l">
          Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings,
          because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to
          create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a
          tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used
          with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on
          the different parts of the template literal.
